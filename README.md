# 🌦️ Weather Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

A visually rich and fully interactive **Weather & Air Quality Dashboard** built using **Power BI** and real-time data from **WeatherAPI.com.**
This project visualizes **current weather conditions, hourly & daily forecasts, air quality indicators, sunrise & sunset times, and rain probability** for multiple locations.

## 📘 About the Project
